## Quickstart

 - `npm install`
 - `npm start` : Runs `serve` and `watch` concurrently for you


Other scripts:

 - `npm run build` : Builds the elm source to public/built/index.js
 - `npm run watch` : Watches elm files in src for changes, and runs `build` when changes are detected
 - `npm run serve` : Starts up a server in the public directory, and live-reloads when public/built/*.js or public/*.css change

Style notes:

  Bootstrap CSS (but not JS) is included.

## Getting Elm set up for the first time

After running `npm install`, a version of Elm will be installed into your
node modules folder, and can be interacted with by running `./node_modules/.bin/elm`.

That folder can just be added to your path, or you can install Elm globally
by typing `npm install -g elm`

Wahoo!
